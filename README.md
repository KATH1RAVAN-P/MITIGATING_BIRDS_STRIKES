Avian Impact Analysis: Data-Driven Strategies for Bird Strike Mitigation



📊 Overview:

Bird strikes pose a significant risk to aircraft safety, causing financial losses and operational delays. This project analyzes historical bird strike data, visualizes key trends, and provides data-driven recommendations to reduce incidents.

🚨 The Problem:

🛫 Frequent Bird Strikes at Low Altitudes – Over 70% of strikes occur below 1000 ft, making takeoff and landing the riskiest phases.🦜 Unknown Bird Species in Majority of Cases – Many bird strikes involve unidentified birds, making targeted mitigation difficult.✈️ Certain Aircraft Types More Prone to Strikes – BLC-type aircraft are impacted the most, necessitating aircraft-specific preventive measures.📅 Seasonal Variation – June has the highest strike occurrences, indicating the need for peak-season interventions.

🔍 Key Insights:

✅ Altitude < 1000 ft sees the highest strikes (70%+ cases)✅ Small and medium-sized unknown birds are involved in most strikes✅ BLC-type aircraft experience the highest number of incidents✅ Clear weather does not reduce strike occurrences significantly✅ June has the highest bird strikes, indicating seasonal risks

🛠️ Recommendations for Risk Mitigation:

🚀 Deploy Radar-Based Bird Monitoring – Real-time bird detection and tracking systems should be implemented to monitor bird activity near airports.🎯 AI-Based Bird Recognition – Machine learning models can help in species identification for targeted deterrent strategies.✈️ Flight Path Optimization – Modify flight paths and altitudes in high-risk areas during peak bird movement hours.🔊 Use Acoustic & Visual Deterrents – Install bio-acoustic deterrents and flashing lights to keep birds away from runways.📅 Seasonal Bird Control Strategies – Special mitigation efforts should be ramped up in June to counter peak strike risks.

📂 Dataset:

The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from aviation safety reports, including historical bird strike incidents categorized by altitude, species, weather, and aircraft type.

💡 Future Enhancements:

🚀 Real-Time Bird Strike Prediction Model – Develop a machine learning model that predicts potential bird strikes based on live data.🦅 Automated Bird Species Classification – Enhance species identification using deep learning image classification models.📡 Airport-Specific Risk Analysis – Tailor bird hazard mitigation plans for different airport locations based on local bird activity data.
